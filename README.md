# SideWalk Labs

* This project aims to investigate the use of data collected by computer vision sensors developed by Numina and analyze how to best improve the quality of life in public spaces.

* Analyzed data collected by sensors deployed at 307 Lakeshore Blvd. Investigated the dwell time of pedestrians in different functional areas and during special events. Developed algorithms to schedule maintenance operations.

* The file `webpage.ipynb` provides users with an interactive webpage to display data to explore dwell time, desired path and maintenance for 307 Lakeshore Blv..

* The file `documentation.ipynb` provides a guide on how to operate the webpage and what data is being displayed.
