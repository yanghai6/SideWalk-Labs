And the regions that pass the threshold are highlighted in the plot, while those regions that do not pass the threshold are shown in dark grey.

    "First, user should select two behavior zones. If user wants to see the how dwell time changes in one specific behavior zone, 1st Zone and 2nd Zone he/she chooses must be the same. For example, if user wants to see how dwell time changes in behavior zone 'Table1', then both 1st Zone and 2nd Zone should be chosen as 'Table1' here. The data we used here is the median dwell time of each day for this behavior zone.<br />\n",
    "If user wants to make a comparison between two behavior zones, he/she should choose two different behavior zones, and after clicking 'Apply', it will display the trend chart of the difference dwell time between the two regions. For example, if 1st Zone is 'Seat' and the 2nd Zone is 'Stair', then we calculated median dwell time for behavior zone Seat minus median dwell time for behavior zone Stair of each day. So if the value is greater than 0, it indicates that the for that day, the median dwell time for 1st Zone is larger than that for the 2nd Zone. In contrast, if the value is less than 0, it indicates that the for that day, the median dwell time for 1st Zone is smaller than that for the 2nd Zone. <br />\n",
    "If user wants to see the specific date or median dwell time, user can hover over that point, and it will display the date and median dwell time for that point. In addition, if user wants to magnify the line chart, there is a zoom in button on the top right corner. Also, if user wants to zoom in one specific region, he/she can creates a square, and the region within the squared will be maginified, and once the user double clicks, it will return to the original plot."

The mechanism is that once the user selects a zone, he or she will be able to see all the paths of the pedestrians that are from or to this behavior zone. If the user select multiple zones, he or she will be able to see all the paths that are either originated or to these zones. The paths are colored by their popularity, meaning that the most popular path will have the darkest color, orange. By selecting different zone, the user only needs to find the connecting lines across the zones, which ideally will be the desire line when an object travels from one of the selected zones to another. If there doesn't exist a connecting line, the user can see the overall pattern and will be able to see the trends by themselves.\n",

    "#### Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are 3 sensors and each sensor might be used in different frequency, they might not need maintenance at the same time. Thus, we schedule the maintenance for each sensor resepctively. The user could choose either `Under raincoat`, `Streetscape` or `Outside`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Range\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that the technical workers for maintenance might not be avaliable anytime. In order for the schedule to fit the schedule of workers, the users could set the time range avaliable to schedule maintenance. We assume each maintenance process would take 1 hour. The maintenance would only be shcedule within this time range.\n",

    "#### Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed that, sometimes, there might be a lot of visitors on sites during the peroid of time supposed to have maintenance. However, the maintenance might cause inconvenience for visitors and it is also difficult to have maintenance when there are lots of people. Therefore, we would like to avoid such situation. In this section, user could choose the maximum number of visitors onsites when having maintenance. The user could choose between 0 (no visitors at all) and the upper bound of all non-outliers (Q3 + 1.5\\*IQR). The maintenance would only be scheduled when there are less than the limit number of visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weekdays only\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the consideration for the time range. The workers might not be avaliable on weekends. Therefore, when scheduling, the user could avoid maintenance on weekends by checking the weekdays_only option.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting all of the five interactions, the user could finally get a schedule under the requirement."
